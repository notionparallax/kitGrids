        <dd>This is a relatively new bag, it has lots of compartments and can fit 2 pairs of shoes, which is good, as I normally carry 2 pairs of shoes in here.</dd>

        <dt>What are you wearing <em>right now</em>?</dt>
        <dd>Just finished a PT, so <a href="http://www.lululemon.com.au/products/category/women-pants?pagesize=All">Lululemon Tights</a>, CF Creature Singlet, a cotton long sleeved top from Cotton On and <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-FLite-195-Black-Teal-Purple-Womens-AW14.html">Inov8s f-lite something. 185 maybe</a>.</dd>
        <dt>How long have you been doing crossfit?</dt>
        <dd>At a gym for about 1 year and a 1⁄2, but used to just do a session once a week with a trainer and about 4 other people for about 6 months prior to that outside at Queens Park. Ewan, the trainer, used to bring along his own equipment and he’d either make up WOD’s for us or we’d do benchmark ones (that we could with the equipment we had) it was fun, except we used to start at 5.45am and when it rained, it sucked.</dd>
        <dt>What gym do you go to?</dt>
        <dd><a href="http://www.crossfitcreature.com/">Crossfit Creature</a>.</dd>
        <dt>What's next on your kit shopping list?</dt>
        <dd>Nothing as I’ve just done a budget and really need to stop spending money on gym stuff. But the next purchase I will make will most likely be shoes.</dd>
        <dt>What do you do as a job?</dt>
        <dd>Accountant</dd>
        <dt>Competition history</dt>
        <dd>I went in a team comp about a year ago and realised that competing in stuff isn’t really my thing, especially when it’s in things I don’t have a chance in winning. And exercising, I’m pretty sure I’ll never win at exercising.</dd>
        <dt>What bit of kit would you use, even if you were sponsored by their competitor?</dt>
        <dd>I’m not really that attached to anything that I would feel the need to do this.</dd>
