<dt class='lifters'>lifters</dt><dd>I got these from a friend for $70. I was hesitant about buying them at all (and especially pay over $150 for them), because I’m really against people who refer to doing “lifting” when in reality they just do exercise which involves a barbell. And I thought this would make me look like a try hard. However I’m glad I did buy them, as they help me with feel more stable when doing overhead stuff. I’m trying to only use them for snatches and OHS, not squatting anymore.</dd>
