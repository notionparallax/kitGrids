        <dt class="jumper"><a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/product/mens-r1-regulator-fleece-hoody?p=40073-0">Patagonia R1 hoodie</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>I've wanted one of these ever since <a href="http://www.andy-kirkpatrick.com/articles/view/patagonia_r1_hoody">Andy Kirkpatrick raved about it</a> but they stopped making it for a while. It has really long arms so I can move about in it as much as I like.</dd>
        <dt class="lifters"><a href="http://www.ironedge.com.au/store/inov8-mens-fastlift-335-yellow.html">Inov8 Fastlift shoes</a></dt>
        <dd>These are my first pair of lifters so I don't have much to compare them to. I'm pretty happy with them though. and I seem to be able to run in them quite hapily.</dd>
        <dt class="shaker">Shaker</dt>
        <dd>I got this for free with my first ever protein powder tub. I've got quite a lot of these now, but this one has some strange sentimental value. It's not very good!</dd>
        <dt class="tupaware"><a href="http://sistemaplastics.com/products/klip-it-utility/900ml-cracker">Protein powder tub</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>This is full of some cheap chocolate stuff that our last housemate left behind.</dd>
        <dt class="bag"><a href="http://reviews.patagonia.com/9248/47910/reviews.htm">Patagonia Refugio bag</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>I bought this on Amazon and I didn't know that this was going to be so pink, Irina calls it my 'big pink vagina bag'. It's got about a million internal pockets which drove me mad as my day to day bag, but is actually quite handy as a gym bag.</dd>
        <dt class="towel">Hotel towel</dt>
        <dd>I get towels on tap at work, and sometimes one comes home with me by accident.</dd>
        <dt class="rope">RX rope with spare cables</dt>
        <dd>I'm still terrible at double unders. I'm using the heaviest rope they do which makes my shoulders burn after about 10 rotations. I'm hoping that if I start heavy and slow it'll get better as I move down the weights. Hoping.</dd>
        <dt class="charger">UE charger</dt>
        <dd>Always carry a charger. This one is from my <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/2/5861556/best-bluetooth-speaker">bluetooth speaker</a> and is a nice bright colour so nobody will pinch it.</dd>
        <dt class="wallet"><a href="http://theutlab.com/collections/origami">UT Lab Tyvec wallet</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>This is my backup wallet; I've lost my good one somewhere in the house. I really like thin wallets and I doubt you can get a wallet much thinner than this one.</dd>
        <dt class="watch"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056DC97I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0056DC97I&linkCode=as2&tag=notioparal-20&linkId=42CWGGQR5EK3H33P">Timex Easy Reader</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=notioparal-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0056DC97I" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></dt>
        <dd>Watches are something I've struggled to get into, but they seem like a grown up thing to have! As I don't have a phone I figured that it'd be good to know what the time is. This one is really simple and pretty cheap too.</dd>
        <dt class="pen">Paint marker</dt>
        <dd>I'd forgotten that this was in here. It will write on most things, and is really good for windows and mirrors.</dd>
        <dt class="keys">Keys</dt>
        <dd>Er, it's my keys.</dd>

        <dt>What are you wearing <em>right now</em>?</dt>
        <dd>I've just finsihed a workout, so I've got my <a href="http://www.betabrand.com/collections/discolab/disco-sport-shorts.html">silver disco shorts</a>, a <a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/10171917_288881524620644_5158907141748250771_n.jpg">purple Creature t shirt</a>, cheap rio socks, and <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-BareXF-210.html">Inov8 210</a>s.</dd>
        <dt>How long have you been doing crossfit?</dt>
        <dd>About 18 months I think</dd>
        <dt>What do you do as a job?</dt>
        <dd>Good question!</dd>
        <dt>Competition history</dt>
        <dd>I've done a few comps in the scaled division and come second in two of them. I guess that makes me second toughest in the infants. I'm a bit too fat to be hitting those heady numbers at the moment.</dd>
        <dt>What bit of kit would you use, even if you were sponsored by their competitor?</dt>
        <dd>I'm pretty ambivalent about all my gear, although I tried on a pair of nanos and my current Inov8s and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to wear nanos. I think that by the time I make it to The Games (in masters 95-100) it won't matter what shoes I'm wearing; comfy Reebok velcros to go with my velour tracksuit.</dd>
        <dt>What isn't in your bag that should be?</dt>
        <dd>I thought that there was some tape in there and some super glue. I also usually have a Nexus 7 tablet with me and some headphones. If I'm doing a long, slow row I'll listen to podcasts with it. I'm taking this photo with the tablet.</dd>
        <dt>Are you sponsored at all?</dt>
        <dd>No, I'm a privateer</dd>
