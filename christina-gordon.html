        <dt>What are you wearing <em>right now</em>?</dt><dd>I am currently wearing my mums Rogue top , I’m really lucky to be able to fit into some of her clothes.  I don’t often train in trackies but it was extremely cold and I didn’t want to get frostbites. I always wear my pink Nano 3.0’s, for me personally they are extremely comfortable.</dd>
        <dt>How long have you been doing crossfit?</dt><dd>I only came once a week during October – December 2013, with no sporting background I came to the conclusion that if I didn’t start training frequently id get fat so then I started coming more often around January this year.</dd>
        <dt>What gym do you go to?</dt><dd>Crossfit Creature</dd>
        <dt>What's next on your kit shopping list?</dt><dd>I would love to get the Teal Nano 4.0’s and some new lululemon shorts. Only if mum buys it for me of course!</dd>
        <dt>What do you do as a job?</dt><dd>I don’t work, but I’m currently in high school (year 11)</dd>
        <dt>Competition history</dt><dd>I went in an individual teen comp around 8 months ago, I enjoyed it but I got mad/frustrated when the girl I tied first place with didn’t even get a no rep for her terrible above parallel squat.</dd>
        <dt>What bit of kit would you use, even if you were sponsored by their competitor?</dt><dd>I’m not attached to anything that badly, but if my Nike Romaleos were in my bag at the time I would definitely still use them!</dd>
