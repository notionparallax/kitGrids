    <dt class='button'>Button</dt><dd>Not sure how this got here... but you always need to be prepared for a button emergency!</dd>
    <dt class='keys'>keys</dt><dd>Having to climb in over the fence and through the window after training is not ideal.</dd>
    <dt class='grips'><a href='http://store.justanotherwod.com/jaw-pullup-grips-for-crossfit/'>JAW grips</a></dt><dd>Jodie had a spare pair of these so she gave them to me. Still getting the hang of them, actually... don't really use them much. Sorry, Jodie!</dd>

        <dt>How long have you been doing crossfit?</dt><dd>Almost 2 years, that's right isn't it? I thought I'd have more pullups by now.</dd>
        <dt>What gym do you go to?</dt><dd>Crossfit Creature</dd>
        <dt>What's next on your kit shopping list?</dt><dd>Probably a new pair of shoes; I'm going to try something other than Nanos, maybe Inov8s</dd>
        <dt>What do you do as a job?</dt><dd>I'm a user experience designer at <a href="http://domain.com.au">Domain</a>, so I sit behind a computer all day</dd>
        <dt>Competition history</dt><dd>I did the <a href="http://crossfitplus.com/2013/05/2013-south-west-smackdown/">2013</a> smackdown and the Open for the last two years.</dd>
        <dt>What isn't in your bag that should be?</dt><dd>A water bottle - um - that's not very exciting, a unicorn! Maybe the question should be what <em>is</em> in your bag that shouldn't be.</dd>
        <dt>What bit of kit would you use, even if you were sponsored by their competitor?</dt><dd>I don't really have any strong ties to my gear yet, maybe when I'm really good I'll care more.</dd>
