        <dt class="bag">Adidas Bag</dt>
        <dd>This is a relatively new bag, it has lots of compartments and can fit 2 pairs of shoes, which is good, as I normally carry 2 pairs of shoes in here.</dd>
        <dt class="towel"><a href="http://www.kathmandu.com.au/accessories/health/towels.html">Kathmandu Quick Dry Towel</a></dt>
        <dd>It’s a towel, which dries quickly, which is nice. But that is not why I use it, it’s the size that appeals to me. I have a variety of towels I use for the gym. Sometimes I use tea towel size ones, as I don’t like carrying bulky towels around.</dd>
        <dt class="lifters">Reebok Lifting Shoes</dt>
        <dd>I got these from a friend for $70. I was hesitant about buying them at all (and especially pay over $150 for them), because I’m really against people who refer to doing “lifting” when in reality they just do exercise which involves a barbell. And I thought this would make me look like a try hard. However I’m glad I did buy them, as they help me with feel more stable when doing overhead stuff. I’m trying to only use them for snatches and OHS, not squatting anymore.</dd>
        <dt class="wristwraps"><a href="http://strengthwraps.myshopify.com/collections/print-fabric-strength-wraps/products/blue-cheetah">Leopard Print Strength Wraps</a></dt>
        <dd>I bought these at the 2014 regionals in Wollongong. Solely because of the print. But they also do help with OH stuff and my tiny weak wrists.</dd>
        <dt class="kttape"><a href="http://www.kttape.com/store/kttape/kt-tape-pink.html#tabDesc">Pink KT Tape</a></dt>
        <dd>Bec (a friend) uses this for taping her thumbs when using the bar. I also started doing this, it stops the bar rubbing directly onto your skin. I know it’s not the proper use for it, but it’s pretty and it comes in strips already for easy use.</dd>
        <dt class="spray3">2 Cans of Hairspray</dt>
        <dd>I have short hair and a fringe – it needs to be controlled because I hate hair in my face when I’m exercising. There are 2 because one is about to run out and also it’s really heavy and I don’t like the way it sits on my hair, but it smells like coconut.</dd>
        <dt class="spray2">The Other Can of Hairspray</dt>
        <dd>See can 1!</dd>
        <dt class="Deodorant">spray1</dt>
        <dd>because smelling at the gym is poor etiquette. And putting deodorant on is super easy.</dd>
        <dt class="bandaid">Band-Aid</dt>
        <dd>my hands are a mess, so in case the callouses rip I carry a band aid around. Just one though.</dd>
        <dt class="tape">Tape</dt>
        <dd>also for ripped hand moments. Although I find it just ends up sliding off my hands.</dd>
        <dt class="bottle"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nikesheruns">She Runs the Night Water Bottle</a></dt>
        <dd>This is from the first ever Nike She Runs the Night run in Sydney, in 2012. It was the last “fun run” I will probably ever do. Because let’s face it, runs aren’t fun.</dd>
        <dt class="rope"><a href="http://www.rxsmartgear.com/toxic-green/">RX Rope</a></dt>
        <dd>for skipping. Tip – if you are going to buy an RX rope – don’t buy light coloured handles, they get dirty quickly.</dd>
        <dt class="kirby">Bobbie Pins and Hair Ties</dt>
        <dd>for my short hair to keep out of my face when exercising. I haven’t worn the headband in a long time though.</dd>
        <dt class="headband"><a href="http://www.lornajane.com.au/accessories/headbands">Lorna Jane headband</a></dt>
        <dd>More hair management!</dd>
        <dt class="socks"><a href="http://www.2xu.com.au/elite-compression-sock-wa1994e.html">2XU Compression Socks</a></dt>
        <dd>I actually just put these in my bag within the last few days, as they were sitting on my couch and needed a new home.</dd>
        <dt class="clothes">Work Clothes</dt>
        <dd>these were in here because I’d just come from work directly to the gym.</dd>
        <dt class="jumper"><a href="http://rival.runningbare.com.au/ProductDetail.aspx?CategoryId=127&ProductId=12813&Colour=BLACK">Running Bare Jumper</a></dt>
        <dd>I packed this because it can be cold when I leave the gym at night but it wasn’t cold enough to wear it tonight.</dd>
        <dt class="wipes"><a href="http://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/product.asp?id=60273">Make Up Removal Wipes</a></dt>
        <dd>for when I come straight from work to take my mascara off before my face gets all sweaty.</dd>
        <dt class="band"><a href="http://www.66fit.com/66fit-exercise-band-loop-medium-red.html">Red Band</a></dt>
        <dd>for helping with my glute strength exercises.</dd>
        <dt class="berocca">Berocca</dt>
        <dd>someone at the gym was giving these away once, I don’t really like the flavor of Berocca however and so I’ve never used it.</dd>
        <dt class="deoderant">Invisi calm</dt>
        <dd>[You can't see me, but I'm calm]</dd>

        <dt>What are you wearing <em>right now</em>?</dt>
        <dd>Just finished a PT, so <a href="http://www.lululemon.com.au/products/category/women-pants?pagesize=All">Lululemon Tights</a>, CF Creature Singlet, a cotton long sleeved top from Cotton On and <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-FLite-195-Black-Teal-Purple-Womens-AW14.html">Inov8s f-lite something. 185 maybe</a>.</dd>
        <dt>How long have you been doing crossfit?</dt>
        <dd>At a gym for about 1 year and a 1⁄2, but used to just do a session once a week with a trainer and about 4 other people for about 6 months prior to that outside at Queens Park. Ewan, the trainer, used to bring along his own equipment and he’d either make up WOD’s for us or we’d do benchmark ones (that we could with the equipment we had) it was fun, except we used to start at 5.45am and when it rained, it sucked.</dd>
        <dt>What gym do you go to?</dt>
        <dd><a href="http://www.crossfitcreature.com/">Crossfit Creature</a>.</dd>
        <dt>What's next on your kit shopping list?</dt>
        <dd>Nothing as I’ve just done a budget and really need to stop spending money on gym stuff. But the next purchase I will make will most likely be shoes.</dd>
        <dt>What do you do as a job?</dt>
        <dd>Accountant</dd>
        <dt>Competition history</dt>
        <dd>I went in a team comp about a year ago and realised that competing in stuff isn’t really my thing, especially when it’s in things I don’t have a chance in winning. And exercising, I’m pretty sure I’ll never win at exercising.</dd>
        <dt>What isn't in your bag that should be?</dt>
        <dd>Probably more than 1 Band-Aid. I should start carrying snacks too. Oh an a toothbrush, to help with hairspraying my fringe back.</dd>
        <dt>What bit of kit would you use, even if you were sponsored by their competitor?</dt>
        <dd>I’m not really that attached to anything that I would feel the need to do this.</dd>
