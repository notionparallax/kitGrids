    <dt class="bag">Adidas Bag</dt>
    <dd>This is a relatively new bag, it has lots of compartments and can fit 2 pairs of shoes, which is good, as I normally carry 2 pairs of shoes in here.</dd>
    <dt class="towel"><a href="http://www.kathmandu.com.au/accessories/health/towels.html">Kathmandu Quick Dry Towel</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>It’s a towel, which dries quickly, which is nice. But that is not why I use it, it’s the size that appeals to me. I have a variety of towels I use for the gym. Sometimes I use tea towel size ones, as I don’t like carrying bulky towels around.</dd>
    <dt class="lifters">Reebok Lifting Shoes</dt>
    <dd>I got these from a friend for $70. I was hesitant about buying them at all (and especially pay over $150 for them), because I’m really against people who refer to doing “lifting” when in reality they just do exercise which involves a barbell. And I thought this would make me look like a try hard. However I’m glad I did buy them, as they help me with feel more stable when doing overhead stuff. I’m trying to only use them for snatches and OHS, not squatting anymore.</dd>
    <dt class="wristwraps"><a href="http://strengthwraps.myshopify.com/collections/print-fabric-strength-wraps/products/blue-cheetah">Leopard Print Strength Wraps</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>I bought these at the 2014 regionals in Wollongong. Solely because of the print. But they also do help with OH stuff and my tiny weak wrists.</dd>
    <dt class="kttape"><a href="http://www.kttape.com/store/kttape/kt-tape-pink.html#tabDesc">Pink KT Tape</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>Bec (a friend) uses this for taping her thumbs when using the bar. I also started doing this, it stops the bar rubbing directly onto your skin. I know it’s not the proper use for it, but it’s pretty and it comes in strips already for easy use.</dd>
    <dt class="spray3">2 Cans of Hairspray</dt>
    <dd>I have short hair and a fringe – it needs to be controlled because I hate hair in my face when I’m exercising. There are 2 because one is about to run out and also it’s really heavy and I don’t like the way it sits on my hair, but it smells like coconut.</dd>
    <dt class="spray2">The Other Can of Hairspray</dt>
    <dd>See can 1!</dd>
    <dt class="Deodorant">spray1</dt>
    <dd>because smelling at the gym is poor etiquette. And putting deodorant on is super easy.</dd>
    <dt class="bandaid">Band-Aid</dt>
    <dd>my hands are a mess, so in case the callouses rip I carry a band aid around. Just one though.</dd>
    <dt class="tape">Tape</dt>
    <dd>also for ripped hand moments. Although I find it just ends up sliding off my hands.</dd>
    <dt class="bottle"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nikesheruns">She Runs the Night Water Bottle</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>This is from the first ever Nike She Runs the Night run in Sydney, in 2012. It was the last “fun run” I will probably ever do. Because let’s face it, runs aren’t fun.</dd>
    <dt class="rope"><a href="http://www.rxsmartgear.com/toxic-green/">RX Rope</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>for skipping. Tip – if you are going to buy an RX rope – don’t buy light coloured handles, they get dirty quickly.</dd>
    <dt class="kirby">Bobbie Pins and Hair Ties</dt>
    <dd>for my short hair to keep out of my face when exercising. I haven’t worn the headband in a long time though.</dd>
    <dt class="headband"><a href="http://www.lornajane.com.au/accessories/headbands">Lorna Jane headband</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>More hair management!</dd>
    <dt class="socks"><a href="http://www.2xu.com.au/elite-compression-sock-wa1994e.html">2XU Compression Socks</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>I actually just put these in my bag within the last few days, as they were sitting on my couch and needed a new home.</dd>
    <dt class="clothes">Work Clothes</dt>
    <dd>these were in here because I’d just come from work directly to the gym.</dd>
    <dt class="jumper"><a href="http://rival.runningbare.com.au/ProductDetail.aspx?CategoryId=127&ProductId=12813&Colour=BLACK">Running Bare Jumper</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>I packed this because it can be cold when I leave the gym at night but it wasn’t cold enough to wear it tonight.</dd>
    <dt class="wipes"><a href="http://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/product.asp?id=60273">Make Up Removal Wipes</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>for when I come straight from work to take my mascara off before my face gets all sweaty.</dd>
    <dt class="band"><a href="http://www.66fit.com/66fit-exercise-band-loop-medium-red.html">Red Band</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>for helping with my glute strength exercises.</dd>
    <dt class="berocca">Berocca</dt>
    <dd>someone at the gym was giving these away once, I don’t really like the flavor of Berocca however and so I’ve never used it.</dd>
    <dt class="deoderant">Invisi calm</dt>
    <dd>[You can't see me, but I'm calm]</dd>

    <dt>What isn't in your bag that should be?</dt>
    <dd>Probably more than 1 Band-Aid. I should start carrying snacks too. Oh an a toothbrush, to help with hairspraying my fringe back.</dd>
