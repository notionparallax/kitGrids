        <p>This is KITGRIDS - get excited!!</p>
        <p>Kit Grids is an experiment to see what crossfitters bring to the gym with them. Some people walk in with nothing and seem to do just fine, others seem to carry bags big enough to live in, and maybe have some friends over. What's in all of these bags? What secret things do people have that give them the edge? This is where we find the answers to all of these questions!</p>

        <p>If you'd like to be featured on here then <a href="mailto:ben+kitgrids@notionparallax.co.uk" title="don't spam me!!">send me an email</a> with a picture of your kit, and a photo of you. I'll wire it into the magic and then get you to fill in the blanks about what everything is.</p>
        <p>Details:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>A photo of your kit</dt>
            <dd>This should be at least 1500px wide. The best kit grids are laid out with a bit of space around each thing, and in a wideish oval. Your layout is a reflection of your personality, so feel free to go super neat or whatever suits you.</dd>
            <dt>A photo of yourself</dt>
            <dd>This is to go with the "What are you wearing <em>right now</em>?" question, so don't get all fancy for it. It's best if we can see all of you in the photo, shoes to head.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Then you send me those photos and I'll send you a link to a google spreadsheet to fill in that explains all the details. (Things are a bit gheto while we get off the ground!)
