        <dd>I've wanted one of these ever since Andy Kirkpatrick raved about it but they stopped making it for a while. It has really long arms so I can move about in it as much as I like.</dd>

        <dd>I got this for free with my first ever protein powder tub. I've got quite a lot of these now, but this one has some strange sentimental value. It's not very good!</dd>

        <dd>Watches are something I've struggled to get into, but they seem like a gron up thing to have! As I don't have a phone I figured that it'd be good to know what the time is. This one is really simple and pretty cheap too.</dd>

        <dt>What isn't in your bag that should be?</dt>
        <dd>I thought that there was some tape in there and some super glue. I also usually have a Nexus 7 tablet with me and some headphones. If I'm doing a long, slow row I'll listen to podcasts with it. I'm taking this photo with the tablet.</dd>

            <dt>What are you wearing<em>right now</em>?</dt>
            <dd>I've just finsihed a workout, so I've got my Inov8 210</a>s.</dd>
            <dt>How long have you been doing crossfit?</dt>
            <dd>About 18 months I think</dd>
            <dt>What gym do you go to?</dt>
            <dd>Crossfit Creature in Marrickville</dd>
            <dt>What's next on your kit shopping list?</dt>
            <dd>STEROIDS!!!</dd>
            <dt>What do you do as a job?</dt>
            <dd>Good question!</dd>
            <dt>Competition history</dt>
            <dd>I've done a few comps in the scaled division and come second in two of them. I guess that makes me second toughest in the infants. I'm a bit too fat to be hitting those heady numbers at the moment.</dd>
            <dt>What bit of kit would you use, even if you were sponsored by their competitor?</dt>
            <dd>I'm pretty ambivalent about all my gear, although I tried on a pair of nanos and my current Inov8s and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to wear nanos. I think that by the time I make it to The Games (in masters 95-100) it won't matter what shoes I'm wearing; comfy Reebok velcros to go with my velour tracksuit.</dd>
            <dt>Are you sponsored at all?</dt>
            <dd>No, I'm a privateer</dd>
