        <p>If you'd like to be featured on here then <a href="mailto:ben+kitgrids@notionparallax.co.uk" title="don't spam me!!">send me an email</a> with a picture of your kit, and a photo of you. I'll wire it into the magic and then get you to fill in the blanks about what everything is.</p>
        <p>Details:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>A photo of your kit</dt><dd>This should be at least 1500px wide. The best kit grids are laid out with a bit of space around each thing, and in a wideish oval. Your layout is a reflection of your personality, so feel free to go super neat or whatever suits you.</dd>
            <dt>A photo of yourself</dt><dd>This is to go with the "What are you wearing <em>right now</em>?" question, so don't get all fancy for it. It's best if we can see all of you in the photo, shoes to head.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Then you send me those photos and I'll send you a link to a google spreadsheet to fill in that explains all the details. (Things are a bit gheto while we get off the ground!)
